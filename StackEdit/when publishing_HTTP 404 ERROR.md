<h1 id="http-404-error"><em><strong>HTTP 404 ERROR</strong></em></h1>
<p>When I tried to publish my file many timesfrom StackEdit to GitHub, <em><strong>http 404 error</strong></em> made me sad.<br>
Now I have solved the problem, I feel really really happy…!</p>
<p>In short, the reason I took the trouble is about the <em><strong>branch</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Usaually simple is not simple, is something difficult for someone<br>
and that is me  :)</p>
<p>In the below I write down the process I met the problem and solved it.</p>
<p>…<br>
Writing English is not easy for me<br>
so I will write down Korean my mother’s language…<br>
( + but I didn’t. haha…)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>그런데 글씨체는 한국어보다 영어가 단정하고 예쁘네<br>
덜 예쁜 폰트로 적…으려다 그냥 쭉 영어로 적었는데<br>
아 힘들다 영어 좀 잘했으면</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="look-the-word-master">look the word <em><strong>MASTER</strong></em></h2>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nft2WtonQZwj6aLVoAMrEzcOcqZROIM_" alt="look the word master"></p>
<p>Look the word and the sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Branch — optional</code><br>
If not supplied, the <code>master</code> branch will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>optional means not optional…<br>
If your repository branch name is ‘main’, you will see the alert below.<br>
<em><strong>HTTP 404 ERROR</strong></em></p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KIEbPQiNf-3yuTX3nq7KOOtI8Oy02Cqy" alt="http 404 error"></p>
<p>In my case, I never had changed my branch name,  <em><strong>main</strong></em> the default name.<br>
And when I tried to get <code>how to use StackEdit</code> in my mother’s language,<br>
there were no info about it.<br>
It just told me that ‘that is optional’ and you don’t need to write down in it.</p>
<p>How sad it is…!<br>
I am beginner in both GitHub and StackEdit,<br>
and also Korean not English who can get many information easy…</p>
<p>Anyway, I could solve it in two ways.</p>
<h2 id="branch-main-on-stackedit">branch <em><strong>main</strong></em> on StackEdit</h2>
<p>First thing is to input your branch name default <em><strong>main</strong></em> on StackEdit.<br>
(If the name is not main, type your own name.)<br>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hKJqAd9D_eGzXFfZadYwZjylEBKil3sm" alt="input your branch name correctly"></p>
<h2 id="branch-master-on-github">branch <em><strong>master</strong></em> on GitHub</h2>
<p>Second is changing your branch name to <em><strong>master</strong></em> on GitHub.<br>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11knVBfY5EFLd5qYJXXsPNlGq7a3zI4Rx" alt="change you branch name"><br>
In your repository, follow the steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Setting &gt; Branches &gt; pencil icon (inside the box) &gt; type "master" &gt; click "Rename branch"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, you can Publish from StackEdit to GitHub without typing in the branch input box.</p>
<p>And also you can change your branch name another not master<br>
and publish to that renamed branch.</p>
<p>Typing English is difficult…<br>
not correct grammar…<br>
sigh</p>
<p>Anyway, you all have a nice day!</p>
