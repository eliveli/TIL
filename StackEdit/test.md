# ***HTTP 404 ERROR***
When I tried to publish my file many timesfrom StackEdit to GitHub, ***http 404 error*** made me sad![enter image description here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nft2WtonQZwj6aLVoAMrEzcOcqZROIM_).    
Now I have solved the problem, I feel really really happy...!

In short, the reason I took the trouble is about the ***branch***.

Usaually simple is not simple, is something difficult for someone    
and that is me  :)

In the below I write down the process I met the problem and solved it.

...
Writing English is not easy for me    
so I will write down Korean my mother's language...    
( + but I didn't. haha....)    

>그런데 글씨체는 한국어보다 영어가 단정하고 예쁘네
덜 예쁜 폰트로 적..으려다 그냥 쭉 영어로 적었는데
 아 힘들다 영어 좀 잘했으면

## look the word ***MASTER*** 
![click publish to github](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hlbmEkal1vPVBdUyuOgZQNu5gtqVIh2i)

![look the word master](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nft2WtonQZwj6aLVoAMrEzcOcqZROIM_) 


Look the word and the sentence.
> ```Branch — optional```  
If not supplied, the ```master``` branch will be used.

optional means not optional..
If your repository branch name is 'main', you will see the alert below.
***HTTP 404 ERROR***

![http 404 error](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KIEbPQiNf-3yuTX3nq7KOOtI8Oy02Cqy)

In my case, I never had changed my branch name,  ***main*** the default name.
And when I tried to get ```how to use StackEdit``` in my mother's language,
there were no info about it.
It just told me that 'that is optional' and you don't need to write down in it.

How sad it is...!
I am beginner in both GitHub and StackEdit,
and also Korean not English who can get many information easy...


Anyway, I could solve it in two ways.
##  branch ***main*** on StackEdit
First thing is to input your branch name default ***main*** on StackEdit.
(If the name is not main, type your own name.)
![input your branch name correctly](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hKJqAd9D_eGzXFfZadYwZjylEBKil3sm)

## branch ***master*** on GitHub
Second is changing your branch name to ***master*** on GitHub.
![change you branch name](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11knVBfY5EFLd5qYJXXsPNlGq7a3zI4Rx)
In your repository, follow the steps.
>``` Setting > Branches > pencil icon (inside the box) > type "master" > click "Rename branch" ```
>
After that, you can Publish from StackEdit to GitHub without typing in the branch input box.

And also you can change your branch name another not master
 and publish to that renamed branch.

Typing English is difficult..
not correct grammar...
sigh

Anyway, you all have a nice day!
